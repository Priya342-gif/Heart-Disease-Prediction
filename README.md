# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient using a classification model trained on medical parameters. It includes data visualization, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and comparison of multiple algorithms.

## 📂 Dataset

**Source**: [Kaggle - Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data)  
**Features include**:
- Age, Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol
- Fasting blood sugar
- Resting ECG
- Max heart rate
- Exercise-induced angina
- ST depression, slope, etc.

The target column indicates the presence of heart disease (1) or not (0).

## 📌 Objectives

- Load and explore the heart disease dataset
- Visualize data to understand relationships and patterns
- Preprocess data (scaling, splitting)
- Train multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)
- Evaluate and compare model performance
- Visualize model predictions
